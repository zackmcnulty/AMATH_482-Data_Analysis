%% Find Modes which are best at separating groups.

% Extract the individual groups (i.e. bands in this case) from the training data
group1 = training_data(training_labels == 1, :);
group2 = training_data(training_labels == 2, :);
group3 = training_data(training_labels == 3, :);

% rearrange training data to be ordered by group
% training_data(:, :, :) = [group1; group2; group3];

% SVD the entire dataset to find principal components
% of "music space"
mean_td = mean(training_data, 2);
[u, s, v] = svd(training_data - mean_td, 'econ'); % mean subtract

% Plot singular values: which are relevant?

singular_values = diag(s) / max(diag(s));
plot(singular_values, 'r.', 'markersize', 20)
title('Normalized Singular Values')
ylabel('\sigma_j')
xlabel('index j')

% Find the modes that best separate the data by projecting each of our
% groups onto the individual components. Note that each column of V gives
% the coordinates of each data measurement (row in X = training_data) onto
% the corresponding principal component (column in U). So entry (i,j) of V
% gives the weighting/"importance" of principal component 


%% Low rank approximation

% Calculate the low-rank approximation that captures at least 90% of the
% energy of the system.
energy_threshold = 0.90;
rank = find(cumsum(singular_values / sum(singular_values)) >= energy_threshold, 1);
X_r = u(:, 1:rank) * s(1:rank, 1:rank) * (v(:, 1:rank)');

%% Test Quality of reconstruction

p8 = audioplayer(test, Fs);

%% Train a SVM model
clc;

% SVM Cannot handle complex numbers so we simply take the absolute value
% To convert the training data to amplitude (all real).

% In this case, as our data measurements are stored as rows, the columns of
% V store the fundamental structure/modes of our system (they form a basis
% for our domain : frequency / music space) while the columns of U give the
% coordinates of each data measurement (i.e. each song) within this
% frequency space. Thus, these coordinates define the underlying structure
% of our system and we can use them to classify.

Mdl = fitcecoc(abs(u(1:rank, :).'), training_labels);
% Mdl = fitcecoc(abs(training_data), training_labels);
% Mdl = fitcecoc(abs(X_r), training_labels);


% Computes the classification Error rate in classification for our training
% data set using the classification conditions defined by our model.
error_rate_training = resubLoss(Mdl)

%% Test how good the model is at predicting labels

correct_predictions = 0;
for j = 1:length(validation_labels)
    % since our model was trained on the coordinates given by U which are the coordinates
    % of our data with respect to the basis V (for frequency space), we have to
    % to get the coordinates of our validation data with respect to this
    % basis: V * data = coordinates_in_V
    
    next_song = validation_data(j, :);
    coordinates_in_V = V \ next_song;
    
    prediction = predict(Mdl,abs(validation_data(j, :))); 
    actual = validation_labels(j);
    if prediction == actual
       correct_predictions = correct_predictions + 1 ;
    end
